# Hybrid Renewable Energy System Simulation

This project simulates an off-grid hybrid renewable energy system composed of solar PV, wind turbines, battery storage, and an optional diesel generator or grid connection.

## Features

- Hourly simulation of solar and wind energy generation
- Battery storage dynamics
- Diesel generator or grid support (fallback)
- Load balance analysis
- Visualization of battery SOC and power flows

## Data

Synthetic hourly weather data (irradiance and wind speed) are included for a full day.
